Introduction

Welcome to the Spring Load Calculator!
This tool is designed to help you calculate the compression of a spring under varying loads. By inputting the original mass, new mass, and original compression of the spring, the program quickly computes the new compression and provides a multiplying factor for the change.

The calculator is perfect for students, engineers, and researchers who need quick and accurate spring compression calculations without manually solving formulas.
What Does It Do?

When a spring is compressed under a certain mass, its compression follows the principle of proportionality based on the square root of the mass. The Spring Load Calculator helps you determine:

    The new compression of the spring when the mass changes.
    A multiplying factor showing the ratio of the compression adjustment.

This tool simplifies physics and engineering tasks, allowing you to focus on the results rather than the calculations.
How to Use the Program

  Launch the Program: Double-click the application to open the graphical interface.
  
  Enter the Inputs:
        Original Mass: Enter the initial mass (in grams) that was compressing the spring.
        New Mass: Enter the new mass (in grams) to calculate the adjusted compression.
        Original Compression: Input the spring's original compression (in millimeters).
  
  Click "Calculate New Compression":
        The program will compute the new compression in millimeters.
        It will also display the multiplying factor showing the proportional change.
  
  View Results:
        The results will appear below the button, showing the updated spring compression and multiplying factor.
  
  Reset Fields (Optional):
        If you wish to perform a new calculation, clear the inputs manually or close and reopen the application.

Notes:

  Ensure all inputs are positive numbers (e.g., mass and compression values cannot be zero or negative).
  Results are rounded to 4 decimal places for the compression and 2 decimal places for the multiplying factor.
  If invalid data is entered, an error message will prompt you to correct it.

Feel free to share feedback or suggestions for future improvements. Happy calculating! ðŸš€

Welcome to the Spring Load Calculator!
This tool is designed to calculate the compression of a spring under different loads. By inputting the original mass, new mass, and original compression of the spring, the program computes:

1: The new compression of the spring.

2: A multiplying factor that shows the proportional relationship between the original and new compression.

Itâ€™s perfect for anyone working with spring mechanics who wants fast, accurate results.

How does it work?

Springs follow a principle where compression is proportional to the square root of the mass applied.
