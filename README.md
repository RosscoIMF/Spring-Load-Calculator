Welcome to the Spring Load Calculator!

This tool is designed to help you calculate the compression of a spring under varying loads. By inputting the original mass, new mass, and original compression of the spring, the program quickly computes the new compression and provides a multiplying factor for the change. SLC calculates how much a spring must compress when the mass of the piston changes, ensuring that the lighter piston retains the same kinetic energy as the heavier one.

To calculate these changes, SLC follows the principle of proportionality based on the square root of the mass and uses a multiplying factor based on the difference in mass between the pistons. This factor helps determine how much the spring needs to be altered. For instance, if the original spring has 20 coils and the multiplying factor is 1.31, the new spring should have 26.2 coils (20 x 1.31 = 26.2), assuming we keep the spring dimensions (wire gauge/mean diameter) and material the same, or alternatively, the new compression minus old compression = amount of additional preload required to use the existing spring. This adjustment ensures that the spring provides a response to the piston that maintains the same kinetic energy, despite the change in mass.

The calculator is perfect for quick and accurate spring compression calculations without manually solving formulas.



How to Use the Program

  Launch the Program: Double-click the application to open the graphical interface.
  
  Original Piston Mass: Enter the original piston mass (in grams)
        
  New Mass: Enter the new piston mass (in grams) 
        
  Original Compression: Input the spring's original compression (in millimeters).
  
  Click "Calculate New Compression"

  View Results:
        
  The program will compute the new compression in millimeters.
  New compression minus old compression = amount of additional preload required if the existing spring is to be used.
  
  It will also display the multiplication factor that represents the proportional change in the number of spring coils required compared to the existing spring.

  The results will appear below the button, showing the updated spring compression and multiplying factor.
  
  Reset Fields:
  
  If you wish to perform a new calculation, clear the inputs manually or close and reopen the application as I couldn't be bothered to implement a reset button. :)

Notes:

  Ensure all inputs are positive numbers (e.g., mass and compression values cannot be zero or negative).
  Results are rounded to 4 decimal places for the compression and 2 decimal places for the multiplying factor.
  If invalid data is entered, an error message will prompt you to correct it.
